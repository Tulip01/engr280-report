# Abstract

## What is an Independent Video Game Studio?

Being an independent game studio means that the studio does not receive financial support from a publisher. The studio is therefore able to make its own decisions about how their products are developed and distributed without worrying about as much pressure from external benefactors.

## How do Independent Video Game Studios operate?

The appeal of being independent is that the studio is able to express itself creatively with greater ease. However, being independent is a risky venture. If games aren’t successful or projects aren’t finished on time, there is a high risk of bankruptcy. Because of this, independent game studios often do contract work for steady income. Independent video game studios have recently been able to achieve remarkable financial income due to platforms such as the web or mobile phones which are not powerful enough to run AAA games made for video game consoles. These platforms encourage development of smaller games based on fun gimmicks or social interaction, which gives smaller game studios a fighting chance against larger studios. Smaller studios benefit from lowered operating costs.

## What are the objectives of this project?
This project’s goal is to study the feasibility of launching a new indie video game studio in Victoria. The studio would develop games for web or mobile platforms.
Here is a list of questions that will be answered.

* What skills does a team need to have to start a studio?
* What platforms show promise for upcoming independent developers?
* What funds can be gathered from the government or other organizations?
* What are all sources of monetary income? What are all necessary spendings?
* What is the minimum profit necessary to avoid bankruptcy?
* What scenarios could arise from decisions in a game development project?
* What decisions should be made to counter which risks?

# Time Plan

1. Study mutually exclusive  and/or independent  projects and define various services and revenue alternatives.

    This can be things such as BC Provincial business start up grants, Kickstarter campaigns for individual game titles or IndieGoGo. If we can think of any various ways to get that initial cashflow kick, toss them in and write a quick blurb.

2. Draw an initial cash flow diagram for each project.

    Using the previous step, we can get an idea of what will be the start up costs and we can look at potential office space, employees, software, licensing and distribution costs.

3. Select the best alternative using:

    Present worth analysis.
    Future worth analysis.
    Annual worth analysis.
    Capitalized cost calculations.
    Payback period calculations.
Comment on the results and explain which method gives the most accurate results, and why?
Justification of the previous step including factors such as expected revenue for games as well as how frequently games can be produced.

4. Perform a sensitivity analysis of multiple-alternative for at least  5 parameters. Study the variation effect of parameters such as first cost, salvage value, estimated life, production rate, material cost, maintenance cost, revenue,

5. Construct at least 3-stage decision tree and use it to evaluate alternatives in your project. Explain by calculations how to trace the best decision path back through the tree.

6. Use scenario analysis to develop and evaluate at least 3 expected scenarios for your project. Calculate  the profit  in each case and comment on the results. (Consider at least 7 variables in your analysis)

7. Explain by examples how  to  use different approaches to make a decision under risk.

   

8. Study the impact of inflation on your project by determining the difference inflation makes between money now and money in the future through the following steps:

    Calculate the present and future worth with an adjustment for inflation over 10 years time period. Draw a figure to explain the changes in the present and future worth for 3 different inflation rates.
    Draw a 3-D curve to explain how the inflation rate affects the profit of your project over 10-year time period. (Profit vs inflation vs time).


9. Use Linear Programming to optimize one of the main components in your project (i.e. maximize the profit or minimize the price).  (At least 2 constraints and 2 variables).

10. Apply straight line and declining balance models to your project.  Explain by
figures the changes in the book value versus time using the two models.
